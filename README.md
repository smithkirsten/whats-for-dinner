# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
Ever wish you had an additional party in your household whose sole job it is to decide what you ear for your next meal? This app is designed to save any cohabitating relationship the struggle of debating who is more "down for whatever", when it comes to finalizing a meal decision. We pick for you!

All a user has to do is select what type of dish they need to make and the app will randomly select and deliver the name of a recipe. Choose from side dishes, main dishes, desserts, or an entire meal!

### Installation Instructions:
Clone this repository to a local machine and open in a code editor. User terminal or other method of opening index.html in a live browser and find out what you're having for dinner tonight!

### Preview of App:

### Learning Goals:
+Use HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
+Strengthen understanding of the DOM vs. the Data Model
+Strengthen ability to listen and react to user input
+Introduce error handling

### Wins + Challenges:
Successes includes: easily identifying where I could integrate error handling and entire meal presentation into code, as I was pseudocoding it out. Struggles mostly pertained to CSS and trying to orient elements correctly without pushing each other off the page.
